Grounding classical planning tasks is a fundamental yet complex problem in automated planning. The Fast Downward planning system is renowned for its effective approach to grounding first-order Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) tasks into the finite-domain representation SASP, employing reachability analysis to reduce the number of ground actions necessary for problem solving. Recent advancements by Correa et al. have further refined reachability analysis.

This thesis presents an implementation of the grounding procedure within the Isabelle proof assistant, where I have formally verified its correctness. The implementation closely follows the methodologies applied in Fast Downward, but I notably exclude the step of invariant synthesis from my process. This results in an output in the propositional planning language STRIPS rather than the finite-domain language SASP. Through this work, I demonstrate that the grounding procedures not only meet theoretical expectations but are also practically viable within a formal verification environment, thus laying groundwork for future explorations into verified planning systems.
