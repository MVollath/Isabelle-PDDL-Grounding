\chapter{Results}
\section{Efficient Implementation}
\warn{\begin{itemize}
	\item proving equivalence between mathematical specification and efficient implementation
	\item no proof of efficiency bounds
\end{itemize}}
\section{Code Generation}
\warn{\begin{itemize}
	\item short explanation of linking external software
\end{itemize}}
\section{Performance}
\warn{\begin{itemize}
	\item re-measure correa implementation
	\item obviously worse but maybe better than expected?
	\item Isabelle generates code into ML, which is less efficient (space + time) than compiled code (correa).
	\item Still, hopefully same order of magnitude
\end{itemize}}
