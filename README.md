# TreeDecompGrounding
An Isabelle implementation including proof of [Correa et al 2023](https://ai.dmi.unibas.ch/papers/correa-et-al-icaps2023.pdf).

Dependencies:
    - [LTS-formalization](https://github.com/anderssch/LTS-formalization): Until I figure out how to do imports better, this has to be in the same folder as my repository, and be named "LTS-foralization".
    - AFP: AI_Planning_Languages_Semantics and Verified_SAT_Based_AI_Planning
